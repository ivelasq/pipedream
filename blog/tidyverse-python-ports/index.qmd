As I've been saying every year for the past seven years or so, I am learning Python. (It's been a journey.)

Python packages like pandas have several ways to work with data. There are several options for indexing, slicing, etc. They have a lot of flexibility but it's difficult to remember all the conventions. I am familiar with tidyverse syntax, which provides a consistent set of verbs to solve the most common data manipulation challenges. If you're like me, you may want to port the wonderful "grammar" of the tidyverse to use in your Python work!
