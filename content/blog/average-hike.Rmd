title: "Taking A Peek into My Hiking Data"
---

Blog post on importing, tidying, and visualizing hiking location data.

<!--more-->

I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done over 100 hikes (depending on your definition of 'a  hike'). I must admit I've been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y3NdGea6yVuoDS7ewUKmuKGZouzU62FHK-aY813TafA/edit?usp=sharing), despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.

Recently, I signed up on [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes. I was so excited by this that I decided to try to visualize the hikes I have done.

I'm structuring this article a bit differently with the results/visualizations first, but for anybody dying to see the data cleaning process, please see the [Methodology](#methodology) or [Visualizations](#viz) sections below! (Interesting, I ran [a poll on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ivelasq3/status/1121536896956428289) in which I asked whether people embed code in the main text of their blog post or at the end. 91% embed in the main text [n = 85]! Still, I prefer having the code at the end).

# Analysis

## Disclaimer 

For data collection, I downloaded each trail's GPX files from AllTrails. Because these data are proprietary, I will not be providing them. Some things to note:

* Because these are data pulled from the website, they are not indicative of my actual hiking path (for example, Franklin Falls is a 2 mile hike in the summer, but in the winter is a 6 mile snowshoe).
* There are hikes that I did back-to-back that I'd consider one hike but the trails might be listed separately on the site. For example, Deception Pass is actually made up of three small loops.

## The hikes are wide and varied

Being fortunate enough to live near multiple mountain ranges, the hikes I've been on come in all shapes and sizes.

I calculated my 'average hike' - that is, the average elevation given the cumulative distance traveled.

## Aggregated Data by Trail
  
In the aggregate, there seems to be  a correlation (r^2 = 0.48) between total distance and total elevation.

## There Exist Categories of Hikes

I ran a quick [cluster analysis](https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering) to see if I can categorize my hikes in any way. Code is in the [Methodology](#methodology) section. Four clusters seemed to be optimal. I have dubbed them:

* Cluster 1: "Let's Get This Over With" (steep & hard)
* Cluster 2: "Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy" (short & flat)
* Cluster 3: "The Sweet Spot" (not too long, not too high)
* Cluster 4: "I Don't Care About My Knees Anyway" (too long for my own good)

## I don't particularly love long hikes

My average hike is 6.4 miles - and most of them are concentrated around that distance. This makes sense as I usually day hike and need to get back at a reasonable time. My shortest hike was 1.18 miles and my longest was 17.85 (the Enchantments...). In these 90 hikes, I hiked around 576 miles.

## I don't dislike high elevation hikes though

Elevation on these hikes ranged from ~0 feet to 4580 feet gain. I averaged 1455.4 feet gain and have climbed 130,984 feet (~24 miles!).

# Methodology {#methodology}

## Choose Packages

It took a bit to decide which packages had the functions needed to run the spatial analyses. In the end, I decided on:

* **plotKML**: A package containing functions to read GPX files.
* **geosphere**: A package containing functions for geospatial calculations. I decided to use this for finding out distances between lon/lat.
* **googleway**: A package allowing access to the Google Maps API. To run this, you need to obtain a Google Maps API key and load it to R by using `set_key()`. I use this for elevation calculations but the API can also obtain distance between points.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(googleway)
library(plotKML)
library(geosphere)

googleway::set_key(API_KEY_HERE)
```


## Upload Data

I downloaded each GPX file from AllTrails and saved them in a file in my project organization. Their file names were TRAILNAME.gpx.

* Using `plotKML::readGPX()` results in the files being loaded as lists.
* I used `purrr` in conjunction with `plotKML()` to handily read them in and add the file name to the list. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# find gpx files
data_path <- 
  here::here("data", "raw", "gpx_files")

files <-
  dir(data_path, pattern = "*.gpx", full.names = TRUE)

# get trail names
names <-
  dir(data_path, pattern = "*.gpx", full.names = FALSE) %>% 
  str_extract(".+?(?=.gpx)")

# read all gpx files
gpx_dat <-
  map2(files,
       names,
       ~ readGPX(.x,
         metadata = TRUE,
         bounds = TRUE,
         waypoints = TRUE,
         tracks = TRUE,
         routes = TRUE) %>%
         list_modify(trail = .y)) # otherwise you can't tell which entry is for which trail
```

## Calculate Elevation

We can use `googleway::google_elevation()` to access the Google Elevation API and calculate elevation for every lon/lat pair from the GPX files. Unfortunately, the API accepts and returns only a few requests at a time (~200 rows for these files). We have over 51,000 rows of data. So, we can create groups for every 200 rows and use a loop to make a call for each 

This results in a list, so we can then create a tibble pulling out the data we want.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
lonlat_dat <-
  gpx_dat %>%
  map_df(., ~.x$"routes"[[1]], .id = "trail") %>%
  select(trail, lon, lat) %>% 
  group_by(trail) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(group_number = (1:nrow(.) %/% 200) + 1) # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32078578/how-to-group-by-every-7-rows-and-aggregate-those-7-values-by-median

dat_lapply <- lapply(1:max(lonlat_dat$group_number), function(x) {
  Sys.sleep(3)
  
  lonlat_dat %>%
    filter(group_number == x) %>% # added a filter so you only pull a subset of the data.
    do(elev_dat =
         data.frame(
           google_elevation(
             df_locations = dplyr::select(., lon, lat),
             location_type = "individual",
             simplify = TRUE)))
  })

dat_lapply_elev_dat <-
  dat_lapply %>%
  map(., ~ .x$"elev_dat"[[1]])

elev_df <-
  dat_lapply_elev_dat %>% {
    tibble(
      elevation = map(., ~ .x$"results.elevation"),
      lon = map(., ~ .x$"results.location"[["lng"]]),
      lat = map(.,  ~ .x$"results.location"[["lat"]])
    )
  } %>% 
  unnest(.id = "group_number") %>% 
  select(group_number, elevation, lon, lat)
```

## Calculate Distance

Now we have a list of trails, longitudes and latitudes along their paths, and the elevation for each of those points. Now we want to calculate the distance along the paths.

* We bring back `lonlat_dat` so we know what trails with which each points are associated.
* To use calculate distance, we can use `distHaversine()` with two sets of lon/lat. We create the second set of lon/lat by creating a new variable that takes the "next" value in a vector (so we're calculating the distance between point A and point B, point B to point C, and so on).
* `cumsum()` accumulates the distances between each set of lon/lat.
* Finally, we calculate the elevation gain for each hike.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
hiking_dat <-
  plyr::join(elev_df, lonlat_dat, type = "left", match = "first") %>% 
  group_by(trail) %>% 
  mutate(elev_feet = elevation * 3.281, # to convert to feet
         lon2 = lead(lon, 1),
         lat2 = lead(lat, 1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(dist = distHaversine(hiking_dat[, 2:3], hiking_dat[, 7:8])/1609.344) %>% # to convert to miles
  group_by(trail) %>% 
  mutate(cumdist = cumsum(dist),
         elev_gain = elev_feet - first(elev_feet)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Create Additional Tables

For nerdy kicks, I also wanted to find out my 'average' hike - that is, the average distance, the average elevation, and the average elevation for each distance. I also wanted to see the total distance and elevation for each trail for which I pulled data.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
avg_elev <- # average elevation by distance
  hiking_dat %>% 
  group_by(round(cumdist, 1)) %>% 
  summarize(mean(elev_gain))

hiking_dat_by_trail <- # total gain/distance by trail
  hiking_dat %>% 
  select(trail, cumdist, elev_gain) %>% 
  group_by(trail) %>%
  summarize(tot_dist = max(cumdist, na.rm = T),
            tot_elev_gain = max(elev_gain)) %>% 
  mutate(tot_dist_scaled = scale(tot_dist), # for cluster analysis
         tot_elev_scaled = scale(tot_elev_gain))
```
