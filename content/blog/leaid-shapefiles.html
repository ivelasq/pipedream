<p>Blog post on {leaidr}, an R package for U.S. school district shapefiles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I would like to introduce <a href="https://github.com/ivelasq/leaidr">{leaidr}</a>, a package for mapping U.S. School District shapefiles!</p>
<p>Inspired by my coauthor <a href="https://joshuamrosenberg.com/">Joshua Rosenberg</a>, the goal of {leaidr} is to facilitate the download and use of school district shapefiles.</p>
<p>School districts in the U.S. have associated local education agency identification numbers (LEAID) used in the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/100largest0809/tables/table_d05.asp">National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data</a>. These are very useful because if you have other datasets with NCES ID’s, then you can (sometimes easily) join them.</p>
<p>It can be very useful to visualize districts and associated data. District shapefiles are available in different places, such as through the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries">NCES</a> and <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/db586ns4974">Stanford Education Data Archive</a>. The package {tigris} also has a school district option, but unfortunately it is missing a few district polygons.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tigris)

ca &lt;- tigris::school_districts(state = &quot;06&quot;,
                               type = &quot;unified&quot;)

plot(ca[&quot;GEOID&quot;])</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/leaid-shapefiles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>{leaidr} downloads NCES’ U.S. district shapefile from Github using ROpenSci’s <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback">{piggyback}</a> package. This is a super helpful package, as Github caps file uploads at 100 MB (and the shapefile is ~170 MB). I originally tried Github Large File Storage (LFS), but it stores files as a hash, not as an actual file. Therefore, I couldn’t figure out how to use it for a package that others can use.</p>
<p>The function <code>lea_get()</code> downloads an R Data file from the Github repo to your designated path and then writes the necessary shapefiles. Then, create an object with <code>lea_prep()</code> by designating where the shapefiles exist and which state(s) you would like. <strong>Note:</strong> For now, you must use the state’s FIPS code. FIPS state codes are numeric and two-letter alphabetic codes to identify U.S. states and certain other associated areas. A reference table is found <a href="https://www.mcc.co.mercer.pa.us/dps/state_fips_code_listing.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have the shapefile, then you can merge with other datasets and plot using packages like {leaflet} and {ggplot2}.</p>
<div id="example" class="section level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through an example where we will merge external data to the shapefile and then map all the districts in California. The external data is from Josh’s <a href="https://github.com/making-data-science-count/covidedu"><code>covidedu</code> project</a>, which scrapes district websites for specific words. In this case, the search terms were “covid*”, “coron*”, and “closure”. I highly recommend using <code>covidedu</code> for easy scraping from a <strong>lot</strong> of district websites!</p>
<p>First, let’s call our libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
# if you haven&#39;t installed the package yet
# devtools::install_github(&quot;ivelasq/leaidr&quot;)
library(leaidr)
library(maptools)
# if you don&#39;t have this downloaded
# install.packages(&quot;mapproj&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Time to get your data! Use {leaidr} to download and prep your shapefiles for California (FIPS == 06). Read in the external data (in this case, <code>summary-of-table-of-links.csv</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must have a GitHub PAT set to run <code>lea_get()</code>. <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html">Happy git with R</a> has a great walkthrough on how to do that.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># download the shapefile into a designated folder
leaidr::lea_get(path = &quot;./test&quot;)

# prep the shapefile for the state(s) you&#39;d like
ca_shapefile &lt;-
  leaidr::lea_prep(path = &quot;./test&quot;, fips = &quot;06&quot;)

# read in the external data that also has NCES ID&#39;s
# this is from the covidedu project
ca_data &lt;-
  read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/making-data-science-count/covidedu/master/output/2020-04-29/summary-of-table-of-links.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Join the CSV to the shapefile.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ca_merge &lt;-
  sp::merge(ca_shapefile, ca_data, by.x = &quot;GEOID&quot;, by.y = &quot;nces_id&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now ‘fortify’ the data - this converts the polygons into points. This is so ggplot can create the plot.</p>
<p>If you get the error <code>isTRUE(gpclibPermitStatus()) is not TRUE</code>, then you need to enable <code>gpclib</code> by running <code>gpclibPermit()</code> (this is part of the {maptools} package, which should have been loaded above). Note that support for <code>gpclib</code> will be withdrawn from maptools at the next major release, so you might have to try something else if the package has been upgraded.</p>
<p>If you run <code>gpclibPermit()</code> and you keep getting <code>FALSE</code>, then you are missing the package {gpclib}. Install the package, then run <code>gpclibPermit()</code> to set it to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>(I don’t know if this is the best/only way to do this - if anybody has suggestions, please let me know!)</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;gpclib&quot;)
gpclibPermit()
ca_points &lt;- fortify(ca_merge, region = &quot;GEOID&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now, join the points and the shapefile data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ca_df &lt;- left_join(ca_merge@data, ca_points, by = c(&quot;GEOID&quot; = &quot;id&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>We can finally plot the shapefile and its data!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ca_map &lt;-
  ca_df %&gt;% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, 
                   y = lat, 
                   group = group,
                   fill = any_link_found),
               color = &quot;gray&quot;, 
               size = .2) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_iv() +
  ggtitle(&quot;COVID-Related Links Found on CA School District Sites&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To make a nicer looking map, then you can use <code>coord_map()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_projected &lt;- ca_map +
  coord_map()

print(map_projected)</code></pre>

<p>Tada! A full school district map for California.</p>

<h2>Call for Collaboration</h2>
<p>Please try out {leaidr}! I hope that it is useful to you in your work. I’d love any collaborators to join me in making it easier/better!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other functionality</strong>: Thinking of: being able to filter shapefiles by NCES IDs as well as states; adding commonly used data (like district demographics).</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong>: If you run into any issues, please post on the <a href="https://github.com/ivelasq/leaidr/issues">GitHub page!</a></li>
