<p>I moved to Seattle at the end of 2016 and since then have done over 100 hikes (depending on your definition of ‘a hike’!). I must admit I’ve been abysmal at tracking any data regarding my hiking activity beyond a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y3NdGea6yVuoDS7ewUKmuKGZouzU62FHK-aY813TafA/edit?usp=sharing">Google spreadsheet</a>, despite the ubiquity of trail tracking apps that exist.</p>
<p>Recently, I signed up on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/">AllTrails</a> to start collecting data on my hikes. The Pro service offers many wonderful features, including the ability to download GPX data on hikes. I was so excited by this that I decided to try to visualize the hikes I have done.</p>
<p>I’m structuring this article a bit differently with the results/visualizations first, but for anybody dying to see the data cleaning process, please see the <a href="#methodology">Methodology</a> or <a href="#viz">Visualization</a> sections below! (Interesting, I ran <a href="https://twitter.com/ivelasq3/status/1121536896956428289">a poll on Twitter</a> in which I asked whether people embed code in the main text of their blog post or at the end. 91% embed in the main text [n = 85]! Still, I prefer having the code at the end).</p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<div id="disclaimer" class="section level2">
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>For data collection, I downloaded each trail’s GPX files from AllTrails. Because these data are proprietary, I will not be providing them. Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because these are data pulled from the website, they are not indicative of my actual hiking path (for example, Franklin Falls is a 2 mile hike in the summer, but in the winter is a 6 mile snowshoe).</li>
<li>There are hikes that I did back-to-back that I’d consider one hike but the trails might be listed separately on the site. For example, Deception Pass is actually made up of three small loops.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-hikes-are-wide-and-varied" class="section level2">
<h2>The hikes are wide and varied</h2>
<p>Being fortunate enough to live near multiple mountain ranges, the hikes I’ve been on come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p><img src="https://ivelasq.rbind.io/img/average-hike_files/joyplot.png" /></p>
<p>I calculated my ‘average hike’ - that is, the average elevation given the cumulative distance travelled.</p>

<div id="aggregated-data-by-trail" class="section level2">
<h2>Aggregated Data by Trail</h2>
<p>In the aggregate, there seems to be a correlation (r^2 = 0.48) between total distance and total elevation.</p>

<div id="there-exist-categories-of-hikes" class="section level2">
<h2>There Exist Categories of Hikes</h2>
<p>I ran a quick <a href="https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering">cluster analysis</a> to see if I can categorize my hikes in any way. Code is in the <a href="#methodology">Methodology</a> section. Four clusters seemed to be optimal. I have dubbed them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster 1: “Let’s Get This Over With” (steep &amp; hard)</li>
<li>Cluster 2: “Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy” (short &amp; flat)</li>
<li>Cluster 3: “The Sweet Spot” (not too long, not too high)</li>
<li>Cluster 4: “I Don’t Care About My Knees Anyway” (too long for my own good)</li>
</ul>

<div id="i-dont-particularly-love-long-hikes" class="section level2">
<h2>I don’t particularly love long hikes</h2>
<p>My average hike is 6.4 miles - and most of them are concentrated around that distance. This makes sense as I usually day hike and need to get back at a reasonable time. My shortest hike was 1.18 miles and my longest was 17.85 (the Enchantments…). In these 90 hikes, I hiked around 576 miles.</p>

</div>
<div id="i-dont-dislike-high-elevation-hikes-though" class="section level2">
<h2>I don’t dislike high elevation hikes though</h2>
<p>Elevation on these hikes ranged from ~0 feet to 4580 feet gain. I averaged 1455.4 feet gain and have climbed 130,984 feet (~24 miles!).</p>

<div id="choose-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Choose Packages</h2>
<p>It took a bit to decide which packages had the functions needed to run the spatial analyses. In the end, I decided on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>plotKML</strong>: A package containing functions to read GPX files</li>
<li><strong>geosphere</strong>: A package containing functions for geospatial calculations. I decided to use this for finding out distances between lon/lat.</li>
<li><strong>googleway</strong>: A package allowing access to the Google Maps API. To run this, you need to obtain a Google Maps API key and load it to R by using <code>set_key()</code>. I use this for elevation calculations but the API can also obtain distance between points.</li>
</ul>

<div id="data-upload" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Upload</h2>
<p>I downloaded each GPX file from AllTrails and saved them in a file in my project organization. Their file names were TRAILNAME.gpx.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>plotKML::readGPX</code> results in the files being loaded as lists.</li>
<li>I used <code>purrr</code> in conjunction with <code>plotKML()</code> to handily read them in and add the file name to the list.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># find gpx files

<div id="calculate-elevation" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculate Elevation</h2>
<p>We can use <code>googleway::google_elevation()</code> to access the Google Elevation API and calculate elevation for every lon/lat pair from the GPX files. Unfortunately, the API accepts and returns only a few requests at a time (~200 rows for these files). We have over 51,000 rows of data. So, we can create groups for every 200 rows and use a loop to make a call for each</p>
<p>This results in a list, so we can then create a tibble pulling out the data we want.</p>

<h2>Calculate Distance</h2>
<p>Now we have a list of trails, longitudes and latitudes along their paths, and the elevation for each of those points. Now we want to calculate the distance along the paths.</p>
<ul>
<li>We bring back <code>lonlat_dat</code> so we know what trails with which each points are associated.</li>
<li>To use calculate distance, we can use <code>distHaversine()</code> with two sets of lon/lat. We create the second set of lon/lat by creating a new variable that takes the “next” value in a vector (so we’re calculating the distance between point A and point B, point B to point C, and so on).</li>
<li><code>cumsum()</code> accumulates the distances between each set of lon/lat.</li>
<li>Finally, we calculate the elevation gain for each hike.</li>
