excerpt: The R programming language is known for its applications to data science, but one of its best assets is the inviting community. Folks from around the world share their lessons learned, best practices, and code to support and inspire others. One tool that helps contribute to the thriving community is the blog. A blog is a wonderful opportunity to record your data stories, gain exposure for your expertise, and support others in their R journey. Thanks to the advancement of tools like R Markdown, you can quickly get up and running with a blog and focus on customization and style. In this talk, we will discuss possible reasons for creating a blog, the pros and cons of a blog, and how to decide on topics. We will then explore tools for creating your blog that make it easy to showcase your R skills, such as blogdown and distill.
