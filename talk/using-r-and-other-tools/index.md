| Abstract   | R is a powerful programming language for statistics and data science with an accompanying ecosystem that supports its use. Interoperability is part of what makes the R ecosystem so rich, enabling users to apply R in a variety of contexts. In this talk, I will discuss packages that allow you to integrate R together with other tools, including Python and Tableau. |
