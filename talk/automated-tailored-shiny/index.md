## Description

Scenario: Imagine the weekly scramble at DemoCo. Isabella, a lonely Marketing analyst, spends hours every Friday manually compiling marketing lead performance data from Salesforce, website logs, and event records into a sprawling Excel report. The tedious, redundant process is both a time sink and a bottleneck. 

Marketing Leadership, who need to identify top-performing platforms, find the mass amount of information in the report confusing. They constantly return to Isabella for clarification or, even worse, don’t reach back out and make misinformed decisions on critical budget allocation. Determined, Isabella decides it’s finally time to automate and tailor this critical dashboard, and save headaches for both Leadership and herself.

In this demo, you will learn how to:

1. Transform redundant, manual, error-prone data compilation into an automated lead performance dashboard with Shiny
2. Integrate diverse marketing data sources for a holistic view
3. Build tailored marketing KPI dashboards that address Leadership’s specific questions
4. Use drill-downs, data visualizations, and LLM-powered summaries to reduce data overload and clarify complex takeaways instantly
5. Provide flexibility in dashboard functionality to meet diverse preferences and needs, from pre-selected insights derived directly from the data to implementing an LLM-powered analytics option
