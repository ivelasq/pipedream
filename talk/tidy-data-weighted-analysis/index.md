  | **Abstract**   | Surveys are powerful tools, but to ensure the accurate interpretation of results, they require specific analysis methods. With the {srvyr} package and tidyverse family of functions, we are able to analyze survey data with weights to derive meaningful results. Our new book, Exploring Complex Survey Data Analysis Using R, goes through how to do this step-by-step. This webinar will start with an overview of the importance of weighting in survey analysis and the framework for conducting survey analysis in R. We will highlight examples from the book, including how to calculate means and perform t-tests. Knowing that publication-ready tables are important, we will show you how to efficiently create reproducible tables using your final weighted data! We will end with time for Q&A and discussion. |
