| **Abstract**   | Discover new ways to share R, Python, and Shiny projects using Quarto Live and Shinylive, no server required! These tools bring R, Python, and Shiny applications to life directly in the browser. Your audience can open a web page and instantly run code or interact with Shiny apps without needing any setup. Quarto Live allows you to embed interactive code blocks, exercises with hints and solutions, and dynamic visualizations within static HTML documents. Powered by WebAssembly, it brings interactivity to your Quarto documents. Shinylive transforms Shiny apps into fully browser-based experiences. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to use these tools to create engaging, interactive documents, dashboards, and educational content that anyone can access, even if they do not have R or Python installed. |
