Pull them into R instead!\"\nimage: thumbnail.jpg\nimage-alt: \"From the Rijksmuseum, pigeons in white and blue.\"\n---\n\n![Rijksmuseum, Pigeons in white and blue (1928)](thumbnail-wide.jpg){fig-alt=\"Abstract blue and white birds repeating on against a white and blue background\"}\n\nThe other day, I was scrolling through my \"liked\" Tweets and got maybe 100 deep when I accidentally clicked a hyperlink and had to restart scrolling from the beginning. The experience made me so frustrated that I started looking up easier ways of perusing one's likes. I found [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@xoelop/how-to-browse-and-search-your-liked-tweets-711fc1b70851) that walked through how to pull liked Tweets into a CSV using Python - so I decided to give it a shot using R.\n\n## Set up your project\n\nFor this tutorial, I set up a project with the following structure. I walk through how to create `like.js` and `like_csv.csv` in the walkthrough.\n\n```{.md}\n+-- code.R\n+-- data\n|   +-- like.js\n+-- output\n|   +-- likes_csv.csv\n```\n\n## Getting liked Tweets\n\n### Step 1: Download your Twitter archive\n\nLike the Python tutorial, you have to first download your Twitter archive. \nGo to https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data, enter your password, and \"Download Archive\". You will get an email when you can download your data - for me, it took a day.\n\nOnce downloaded, open the ZIP file. Save the `like.js` file in your project's `data` folder.\n\n### Step 2: Load the JS file and convert it to a data frame\n\nNow, start an `R` script (I called mine `code.R`). Install (if you haven't already) and load all the packages.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rjson)\nlibrary(rtweet)\n```\n:::\n\nThe `like.js` file is a Javascript file. To convert it to a data frame, first convert to a JSON file by removing the text that makes it Javascript, read in the JSON, and then flatten into a data frame using `purrr::flatten_df`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njs <- read_file(here::here(\"data\", \"like.js\"))\njson <- sub(\"window.YTD.like.part0 = \", \"\", js)\n \nlikes_raw <-\n  fromJSON(json)\n\nlikes_df <-\n  likes_raw %>% \n  flatten_df()\n```\n:::\n\nNow your likes, their status IDs, and URLs are stored in `likes_df`.\n\n### Step 3: Authenticate {rtweet} and get tweet info\n\nTo get the Tweet info, you have to authenticate your Twitter account and get the API keys. Go to your [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) to do this. The {rtweet} vignette [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html) covers what to do pretty well, but one thing I noticed is now you have to enable \"3-legged OAuth\" and there, you can add the Callback URL of `http://127.0.0.1:1410` (otherwise you will get a 401 error when running the code below).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoken <-\n  create_token(\n    consumer_key = \"PUT API KEY IN QUOTES HERE\",\n    consumer_secret = \"PUT API KEY SECRET IN QUOTES HERE\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\nOnce your `token` is saved, you can use `rtweet::lookup_statuses` to get the Tweet info.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlikes_dat <-\n  lookup_statuses(likes_df$tweetId)\n```\n:::\n\nThere you have it! All your likes and their information are saved in the `likes_dat` data frame. Here, you can do all of your usual data manipulations - `lookup_statuses()` results in a LOT of data, so I recommend narrowing it down to the columns you care about using `select()`.\n\n### Step 4: Save to a CSV\n\nSaving to a CSV is a bit tricky because `lookup_statuses()` creates list-columns, which cannot be exported to a CSV.\n\nHere, I've selected only the columns `status_id`, `text`, and `hashtags` to look at. `hashtags` is a list-column because one Tweet may have multiple hashtags, which is then saved as a vector within the column `hashtags`. To convert it to a data frame, I use `unnest()`. This creates a data frame with multiple entries for each Tweet, one for each hashtag.\n\nThat is too long for me since I want to quickly look through my likes. I then create a hashtag ID for each tweet by grouping by the `status_id` and assigning each of its hashtags an ID using `row_number()` and then using `pivot_wider()` to move each hashtag into its own column.\n\nYou will see that some tweets have blank entries while some tweets have many!\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlikes_csv <-\n  likes_dat %>% \n  select(status_id, text, hashtags) %>% \n  unnest() %>% \n  group_by(status_id) %>% \n  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_prefix = \"hashtag_\",\n              names_from = id,\n              values_from = hashtags)\n```\n:::\n\nNow, this is savable in a CSV. You can run the code below if your project has an `output` folder.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwrite_csv(likes_csv, here::here(\"output\", \"likes_csv.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\nThank you for reading this quick entry in looking through your Twitter likes. I hope this reduces the amount of annoying scrolling you need to do to look through your Tweets! I think there are a lot of opportunities to make this an even easier process - maybe a Shiny app? - but hopefully, this is a good starting point.\n\n<center>\n*Liked this post?
